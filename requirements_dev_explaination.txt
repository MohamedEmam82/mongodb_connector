#==========================#
pytest==7.1.3
# Pytest is a Python testing framework that can be used to write various types of software tests, 
# including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and functional tests. 

tox==3.25.1
# tox aims to automate and standardize testing in Python. It is part of a larger vision of easing the 
# packaging, testing and release process of Python software (alongside pytest and devpi).
# a generic virtual environment management and test command line tool you can use for:-
#   - Checking your package builds and installs correctly under different environments 
#     (such as different Python implementations, versions or installation dependencies),
#   - Running your tests in each of the environments with the test tool of choice,
#   - Acting as a frontend to continuous integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and 
#     merging CI and shell-based testing.

black==22.8.0
# Black: An uncompromising code formatter that automatically formats your Python code to follow 
# PEP 8 guidelines.
# PEP 8 provides guidelines for writing clean and readable Python code. Some key practices include:
#   - Limit lines to 88 characters (instead of the older 79-character limit).
#   - Use double quotes for strings.
#   - Use consistent indentation (usually 4 spaces).
#   - Follow naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
flake8==5.0.4
# flake8: A code linting tool that checks your code against PEP 8 and identifies potential issues.
mypy==0.971
# Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check them. 
# mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it can catch many programming errors by analyzing 
# your program, without actually having to run it. 
# mypy has a powerful type system with features such as type inference, gradual typing, generics and 
# union types.
